# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains various Python practice projects to help sharpen coding skills. Below is a brief overview of the projects included.

---

## 1. Calculator

A simple Python calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and engnieering operations such as trigonometric functions.

## 2. Game of Life

### About the Game of Life

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. It simulates how cells live, die, or multiply based on simple rules:

- A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation (survival).
- A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

### My Python Implementation

This project is my Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life. It randomly initializes a board and follows the rules to simulate cellular evolution.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NuttyJamie/Python-practice.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Python-practice
    ```
3. Run the Python scripts for each project:
    <!--python calculator.py-->
    ```bash
    python game_of_life.py
    ```

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest improvements to these projects!
